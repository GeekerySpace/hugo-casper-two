BEGIN rant

These breaking changes totally suck. There've been breaking changes with 0.45, 0.55, 0.57, 0.58 (0.58 re-introduces the same changes from 0.57 that were subsequently removed in a subsequent 0.57.x patch release).

The Hugo devs should start taking their product seriously, b/c it is a serious product *with already many end users*.
